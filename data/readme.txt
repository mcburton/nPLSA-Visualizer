I expect three kinds of files in this directory. 
nplsa.model.NUM	- the topic-word distributions. One topic per line.
nplsa.topicMixture.NUM	- the topic-document distributions. One document per line.
nplsa.topicSize.NUM - the size of each topic. one topic per line.

There should be many copies of each of these file types, one for each iteration step of the algorithm.
