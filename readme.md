# nPLSA Visualizer 

This repository contains a set of scripts, a directory structure, and the HTML scaffold for the nPLSA visualization tool. 


topic-viz.py - This script processes the output of nPLSA topic models and produces JSON files to drop into the static HTML directory (described below).

./data - put the data files produced by the nPLSA topic model in this directory. The script expects to find the following files:
- nplsa.topicSize.NUM 
- nplsa.model.NUM 

in this directory so that it can produce the JSON files needed for the visualizations. 

./html - This is a directory for holding the contents of a static HTML site built from the data generated by the topic model.


Once you have put the nPLSA model files in the ./data/ directory, you can run topic-viz.py. But before you do that, you need to install a few python packages. topic-viz.py relies on [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Scipy](http://scipy.org/), and [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org). These libraries are needed for the dimension reduction step that uses PCA in the scikit-learn package. The best way to install these packages is with ```easy_install```:

```
easy_instal numpy
easy_install scipy
easy_install scikit-learn
```

The installation of these packages might take a while, scipy has to compile FORTRAN. If you have difficulty or those installation steps don't work (which is highly likely), please let me know.

Once you have gotten those packages install AND you have the model output in the ./data/ directory then you can run the script:

```
python topic-viz.py
```

Assuming this works correctly (again, highly unlikely) the script should have generated 3 JSON files in the ./html/ directory:
- meta.json
- topicGraph.json
- topicSize.json

Once these are in the ./html/ directory you are GOOD TO GO. Now all you need to do is serve up the HTML directory from a web server. The fastest and easiest way to do this is with the python simple HTTP server.
```
cd html
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888
```

Now just visit [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) and you should see the website. 

Good Luck!
