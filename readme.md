# Topic Model Vizualization Kit (TMVK)

This repository contains a set of scripts and a directory structure


topic-viz.py - This script processes the output of nPLSA topic models and produces JSON files to drop into the static HTML directory (described below).

/data - put the data files produced by the topic model at each iteration in this directory. The script expects to find nplsa.topicSize.NUM in this directory so that it can produce the topic size stacked area chart. 

./html - This is a directory for holding the contents of a static HTML site built from the data generated by the topic model.
